#UDP Ping/Reliable File Send Project
Included in this project are two simple applets.

##UDP Ping
Sends a simple, repeated ping packet to a server. As directed by Kurose' programming excercise.

##UDP Reliable File Send
Uses a simple GBN error handling protocol to reliably send a file to a specified server.
Recognizes errors through duplicate ACK messages and through timeouts.
