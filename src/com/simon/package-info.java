/**
 * This package contains two separate Java applets.
 *
 * The first is a UDP ping sender, which can connect
 * and send pings to a server through UDP.
 *
 * The second is a Reliable UDP client/server applet
 * that will send a file through UDP and ensure its
 * arrival through a SYN/ACK GBN protocol. It is currently
 * configured to send a gibberish text file contained
 * in the package, but a comment within the RUC method can
 * be deleted to allow file specification through terminal
 * arguments.
 *
 * Specific citations for code are given at each relevant class.
